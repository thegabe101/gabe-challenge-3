## Description

This project involved creating a password generator that could create a completely random password from a user chosen array of possible symbols.

- The motivation for creating this project was getting an introduction into the interactivity JavaScript provides a user with a traditional HTML page.
- I built this project in order to get my feet wet in JavaScript. HTML and CSS were one thing (visual), but allowing a web user to actually interact with and use a webpage for a purpose or function is an entirely different layer of web development and requires a different thought process from the developer. Instead of asking themselves, "How will this look?" or "How will my elements fit together on a page and present themselves in an accessible manner?", enabling interactivity requires the developer to ask themselves how code can cascade variables and functions (abstract) in a sequential order to produce user-side interactivity (literal).
- This is actually quite a useful webpage for a first, simple, JS project. This solves the problem of password generation for a user who needs a new password. On the developer side, the problem-solving involved was wrapping pieces of starter code (the skeleton of a password generation website) into a fully-functioning website with the capability to generate a password. The primary challenge in this for the developer was grabbing parameters from the user for the password they wanted to generate and tying those parameters to a function within the provided text-area itself.
- I learned a ton from this project- but still have so much to learn. The actual password-generating randomizer function is quite simple and straightforward, as was the concept of the if/else conditions that confirm or disconfirm user preferences for characters within a password. Tying it all together, though, took me 10-12 hours, with many of those hours spent simply staring at the screen for awhile pondering what I was even trying to do. Reframing my task when stuck in English, rather than code, was a useful method of problem-solving for me, as sometimes I found myself staring at variables and functions and thinkng about their names rather than what I actually wanted them to do in English. There were several methods and other pieces of code I had to look up, study, or refamiliarize myself with, including the isNan method, arrays vs. strings, and nesting functions within functions. I was also confused about global vs. local scope in some of my variables and still am.

## Installation

- No special installation of any program is required to use the password generator. It should function in any modern web browser and a copy/paste command can move the password outside to the desired landing space.

## Credits

- I could not have completed this project without the help and encouragement my professor Joe Ruefess, TA's (especially William and Henry on this one), W3Schools, MDM, and my tutor Jacob Carver.

## Usage

-Using this website is straightforward. Once the page loads, click the "Generate Password" button, and a series of prompts asking about length, special characters, and other things you want in your password (or don't) will pop up. Once you complete the prompts, the generator will give you a password in the text-box that can be copy/pasted and used at your discretion.
